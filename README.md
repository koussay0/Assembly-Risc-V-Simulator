# Assembly-Risc-V-Simulator
Risc-V Basic Simulator


Run the Assembly RISC V Simulator Main Program then specify the input file name through the terminal and you will see the results there. 

We implemented a static Web Page index.html but due to time constraints , it only accepts the input file and then ouputs it without processing the input through the C++ Code. There is a need to link the C++ Code through an API into the HTM via Javascript but this requires extra-time. 

Thanks You !
